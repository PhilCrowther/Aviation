This repository contains aviation-related resources designed to simulate 3D flight in three.js.  This includes a flight simulation module (Flight3), an ocean simulation module (Ocean3), and a fully animated WWII fighter airplane (FM2).

The repository includes several sample programs that show how to use these resources.
The fdem programs show a basic airplane flying over the ocean (using the ocean module) and land.
The fmod programs show detailed airplane models flying over an animated ocean with simple clouds.
The fsim program is a basic flight simulation which uses the flight and ocean simulation modules.

You can run these programs and load these resources using the following syntax:
