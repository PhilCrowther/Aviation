<h2>An Aviation Resources Repository</h2>
<p>
This repository contains aviation-related resources designed to simulate 3D flight in three.js.<br>
This includes a flight simulation module (Flight3), an ocean simulation module (Ocean3), and a fully animated WWII fighter airplane (FM2).<br>
The repository includes several sample programs that show how to use these resources.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The fdem programs show a basic airplane flying over the ocean (using the ocean module) and land.</li>
	<li>The fmod programs show detailed airplane models flying over an animated ocean with simple clouds.</li>
	<li>The fsim program is a basic flight simulation which uses the flight and ocean simulation modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can run these programs and load these resources using the following syntax:
